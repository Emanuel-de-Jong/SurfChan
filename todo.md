**TODO**
- fixed step timestamps
- speed up for faster training
- mid train save and resume on cancel or crash
- terminated/truncated when
    - fallen (negative reward)
    - max time/frames depleted
- infer script
- fix stuttering
- advanced rl techniques
    - clipped objective
    - entropy regularization
    - LSTM/GRU layer
    - frame stacking/short memory
- full linear map with trace points
- multiple maps (https://chatgpt.com/share/67a9d4b2-def8-8003-b0ff-6ebd88052055)
